*** Euler Characteristic
$$\chi = V - E + F = 2$$

* Regular polyhedra
[[file:dodecahedron.png]]
** Gotta catch'm all!
    - $n$ edges per vertex: $$E = nV/2$$
    - $m$ vertices per face: $$F = nV/m$$

    $$V - \frac{nV}{2} + \frac{nV}{m} = 2$$

** solve for integer $n$ and $m$
    - $m = 3, n = 3$, tetrahedron
    - $m = 3, n = 4$, octahedron
    - $m = 3, n = 5$, isocahedron
    - $m = 4, n = 3$, cube
    - $m = 5, n = 3$, dodecahedron

   No more possible solutions! *Do* try this at home!

* Topology
[[file:mug-torus.gif]]
** But what is it really?
Dixit Wikipedia: Formally, let $X$ be a set and let $\tau$ be a family of subsets of $X$. Then $\tau$ is called a topology on $X$ if:

1. Both the empty set and $X$ are elements of $\tau$.
2. Any union of elements of $\tau$ is an element of $\tau$.
3. Any intersection of finitely many elements of $\tau$ is an element of $\tau$.

If $\tau$ is a topology on $X$, then the pair $(X, \tau)$ is called a topological space.

** Open sets
The members of $\tau$ are called /open sets/ in $X$.

** Neighbourhoods
A subset of $X$ including an open set containing a point $x \in X$ is called a /neighbourhood/ of $x$.

** The Torus
[[file:torus.png]]
$$V = 1\quad E=2\quad F=1\quad \chi = 0$$

* (Simplicial) Homology

** Simplicial complexes
[[file:simplicial-complex.svg]]

*** boundary operator
- set of /n/-cells
  - vertices, edges, faces, cells

- boundary operator $\partial$
  - cells $\to$ faces
  - faces $\to$ edges
  - $\dots$
  - vertices $\to$ $\emptyset$
- Modulo 2 arithmetic

*** Euler characteristic
- again:
$$\chi = \#v - \#e + \#f - \#c$$

** Betti numbers
- Formally, the /i/-th Betti number, denoted $\beta_i$, is the rank of the /i/-th homology group on a topological space.

| dimension | description        |
|-----------+--------------------|
|         0 | number of objects  |
|         1 | number of loops    |
|         2 | number of cavities |

- Fundamental topological invariants, for example:
$$\chi = \beta_0 - \beta_1 + \beta_2 \dots$$

** Filtration
- start adding /n/-cells (sorted by some measure)
  - rule: boundary of cell should be added first!

| n-cell     | $\beta_0$ | $\beta_1$ | $\beta_2$ |
|------------+-----------+-----------+-----------|
| 0 (vertex) |        +1 |         0 |         0 |
| 1 (edge)   |        -1 |        +1 |         0 |
| 2 (face)   |         0 |        -1 |        +1 |
| 3 (cell)   |         0 |         0 |        -1 |
|------------+-----------+-----------+-----------|
| $\chi$     |         + |         - |         + |

** Persistence
[[file:barcode.png]]

$$\mathcal{P} = [{\rm time\ of\ death}] - [{\rm time\ of\ birth}]$$

* The End
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology][List of Softwares]]
- To the notebook!

** What about the eScience center?
- Write an extensive blog:
  - introduce the subject
  - link to live notebooks
  - evaluate existing software

* Extras
** Derivation of Euler's polyhedron formula
- Draw any planar graph
- Mark a spanning tree
  $$\#e_{\rm t} = \#v - 1$$
- Draw the dual of the graph
- Mark the complement of the previous spanning tree in the dual graph
  $$\#e_{\rm d} = \#f - 1$$
- All vertices, edges and nodes are accounted for!
  $$\#e = \#e_{\rm t} + \#e_{\rm d}$$

** Gauss-Bonnet theorem
- Total curvature relates to Euler characteristic

$$\int_M K\;dA+\int_{\partial M}k_g\;ds=2\pi\chi(M)$$

- Total curvature of torus is 0.
