#+TITLE: Short introduction to Topological Data Analysis

[[file:dodecahedron.png]]

This repository contains a talk about TDA. The slides are not very self-explanatory (yet). Pull-requests are welcome to expand or elucidate some of this highly technical material.

* Slides
The slides are written in Emacs Org-mode, and exported to =reveal.js=. To run them from this repository, clone reveal.js into the project root.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js
#+END_SRC

** Dodecahedron image
The image of the dodecahedron is rendered with [[http://www.blender.org][Blender]].

* Reading material
- [[https://medium.com/basecs/k%C3%B6nigsberg-seven-small-bridges-one-giant-graph-problem-2275d1670a12][Vaidehi Joshi - Blog on Bridges of Königsberg]]
- [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08227.pdf][Wasserman - Topological Data Analysis (pdf)]]
- Edelsbrunner & Harer: Computational Topology, an introduction (book)

* Notebook
The notebook gives an example of using Gudhi to plot a persistence diagram in Python.

** Prerequisites
   - Jupyter (Lab)
   - Numpy
   - Matplotlib
   - IPyWidgets
   - Cython
   - Gudhi [[http://gudhi.gforge.inria.fr/python/latest/installation.html][(installation manual)]]

   Also to get =ipywidgets.interactive= running in Jupyter Lab, you'll need to run

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
#+END_SRC

** Installing Gudhi
Not entirely trivial after all. After unpacking the sources (a tar.gz in a zip???), we need to build the sources. Make sure you have Cython, CGAL and Eigen3 installed. I like to use the =ccmake= command to configure the build, since it gives a nicer interface and shows if you are missing some dependencies or not. Also run this in a Python virtual environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :eval no
mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..        # press 'c' and then 'g' if all's well
make
cd cython
pip install .    # this will build and install the python module
#+END_SRC
